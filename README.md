Experiments to do:
1. Train greenhill act1 model on greenhill act2, see how long convergence takes. 
2. Apply filters from sonic_utils in retro baselines repo, they seem helpful
3. Train blank model on greenhill act 2, compare time to act1 model
4. Train any greenhill model on different stage, see how long convergence takes.
